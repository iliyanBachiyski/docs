[Blockchain Oracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_oracle) serve as intermediaries that connect smart contracts with external (off-chain) data.

---

Oracles can provide:

- **Price Feeds:** Real-time pricing for cryptocurrencies, stocks, or commodities.
- **Event Information:** Updates on real-world events like sports results or weather conditions.
- **API Access:** Connections to external web services and systems.

:::info
Oracles, being external third-party services, require careful consideration of their reliability, security, and decentralization to avoid risks such as incorrect data, manipulation, or single points of failure.

## Pyth Network Oracle

- **Creator:** [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network)
- **Documentation:** [Pyth NEAR Docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/use-real-time-data/near)
- **Codebase:** [pyth-network/pyth-crosschain](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/near)
- **Deployed Addresses:**
  - Mainnet: [pyth-oracle.near](https://nearblocks.io/address/pyth-oracle.near)
  - Testnet: [pyth-oracle.testnet](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/pyth-oracle.testnet)

### Pyth Network Capabilities

Pyth's NEAR smart contract provides the following core price feed methods:

- `update_price_feeds`: Refreshes multiple feeds with fresh data.
- `get_price`: Fetches current prices for specific feeds.

See Pyth's [`receiver` contract methods documentation](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/near/receiver/src/ext.rs) for a complete detailed list.

### `update_price_feeds`

Calling Pyth Network Oracle's  `update_price_feeds` smart contract method  Updating price feeds on the Pyth Oracle contract is done through a few steps:

1. Get Price IDs from [NEAR Pyth Price Feeds](https://www.pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#near-testnet)
2. Fetch the current price feed update from Hermes API
3. Convert the returned base64 blob to hex
4. Call `update_price_feeds` with the hex-encoded price feed

#### Get Price IDs

- **Testnet:** [NEAR Pyth Price Feeds](https://www.pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#near-testnet)
- **Mainnet:** [NEAR Mainnet Price Feeds](https://www.pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#near)

#### Fetch Price Feeds

https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/how-pyth-works/hermes


Using the price ID, fetch the current price using `/get_vaa` endpoint.

- **Testnet:** [hermes-beta.pyth.network](https://hermes-beta.pyth.network/)
- **Mainnet:** [hermes.pyth.network](https://hermes.pyth.network/)
- Fetch the current price feed update from the [Hermes API](https://hermes-beta.pyth.network/).


https://hermes-beta.pyth.network/api/get_vaa?id=${priceId}&publish_time=${publishTime}


```

#### Convert to Hex

Convert the returned base64 blob to hex.

Here is an example of the entire process:

Check `_app.js` and `index.js` to understand how components are displayed and interacting with the contract.

You have two options to start the Counter Example.

1. You can use the app through `GitHub Codespaces`, which will open a web-based interactive environment.
2. Clone the repository locally and use it from your computer.

### Updating Pyth Oracle Price Feeds


Note: The parameters gas and attachedDeposit are specific to NEAR and must be adjusted based on your contract's demands. While any unused deposit will be refunded, it's advisable to estimate potential costs by invoking the get_update_fee_estimate method on the Pyth contract.

Updates can be submitted to this call and sourced from the [Hermes API](https://hermes-beta.pyth.network/) for testnet. To try this out, use the `get_vaa` endpoint to request a price feed
update. Remember, you must convert the returned base64 blob to
hex before using it in the `update_price_feeds` call due to NEAR requiring hex encoding for byte data.

Integrating this updating process directly within your contract can streamline operations by reducing the number of transactions needed. For implementation details, refer to the example contract linked below.

Refer to the [Pyth example contract](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/near/example) for more detailed integration approaches.

:::info
Gas and attachedDeposit are NEAR-specific parameters that you
may need to set depending on the contract's requirements. Unused
deposit will be refunded, but you can calculate an esimtate by calling
the `get_update_fee_estimate` method against the Pyth contract.
:::

## On-Chain Prices

For on-chain price interactions, see the [example contract](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/near/example) in the Pyth Github repo for an example of how to update and use prices within a NEAR contract.

A CLI-based approach can also be taken for interacting with Pyth prices,
see the [update.sh](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/near/scripts/update.sh) example script in the repository to see how to pull prices with the official NEAR cli.

## Contract Addresses

Developers will need the address of the Pyth price feed contract on their blockchain in order to use Pyth.
Please consult [Near Contract Addresses](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/near) to find the address for your blockchain.
